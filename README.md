## Hi there 👋 Tiago Menegaz here!

I'm a software engineer with over 8 years of hands-on experience in Ruby, Python, and JavaScript development, specialising in building scalable, robust applications using Rails, Django, and Flask from monoliths to microservices.

Below are some icebreakers about me:
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React by creating an Airbnb-like open-source project [here](https://github.com/tiagomenegaz/ara-mim).
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any Ruby/Python open-source project. My first contribution is to [ViewComponent](https://github.com/ViewComponent/view_component)
